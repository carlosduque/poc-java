 * 1.2.16 Rational numbers. Implement an immutable data type Rational for rational
 * numbers that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

 * | Rational |  minus(Rational b)                          | difference of this number and b |
 * | Rational |  times(Rational b)                          | product of this number and b    |
 * | Rational |  divides(Rational b)                        | quotient of this number and b   |
 * | boolean  |  equals(Rational that)                      | is this number equal to that ?  |
 * | String   |  toString()                                 | string representation           |
 *
 * You do not have to worry about testing for overflow (see Exercise 1.2.17), but use as
 * instance variables two long values that represent the numerator and denominator to
 * limit the possibility of overflow. Use Euclidâ€™s algorithm (see page 4) to ensure that the
 * numerator and denominator never have any common factors. Include a test client that
 * exercises all of your methods.
